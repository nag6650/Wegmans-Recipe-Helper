# Wegman's Recipe Helper

Wegman's Recipe Helper is designed to make home cooking easier! Simply input the URL of a recipe on the Web UI and a list of ingredients will be generated. After the customer confirms the ingredients (adding and deleting elements as neccessary), a convenient view is generated for every itemâ€“name, price, and location. With this tool, going from recipe to dinner table has never been easier!
